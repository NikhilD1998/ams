## 1. Which AI tools you used and why

I used **GitHub Copilot** to assist with React Native and JavaScript development. Copilot was chosen for its ability to quickly generate code snippets, suggest bug fixes, and provide context-aware recommendations, which helped speed up the development process.

## 2. Example prompts that worked well

- "Move fetch logic to context."
- "Add a logout button to the AdminDashboard similar to ParentDashboard."
- "Block the back gesture on this screen."

## 3. Code sections where AI helped significantly

- Implementing the logout button and navigation logic in `TeacherDashboard.jsx`.
- Refactoring data-fetching logic into `AppContext.jsx`.

## 4. Problems AI couldn't solve

- Specific build errors related to CMake and native module autolinking required manual investigation and were not fully resolved by AI suggestions.
- Some project-specific logic (like Firestore data structure) needed manual adjustments.

## 5. Time saved using AI (estimated)

Estimated time saved: **6-8 hours**  
AI helped by quickly scaffolding components, suggesting fixes, and reducing
